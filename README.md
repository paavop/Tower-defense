# Tower-defense
A tower defense game developed for a course "CSE-A1121 Ohjelmoinnin peruskurssi Y2" at Aalto University (Spring 2016).

In this game you are faced with increasingly difficult waves of enemies trying to invade your land. Build 'towers' and other defenses to ward off the attack. The game features four different enemy-types and four different tower-types.

The game is built on Python 3 and uses Pygame-library to display 2D-graphics.
